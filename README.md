The focus of sentiment analysis is to derive information from human language for interpreting views and feelings to assign polarities like positive, negative, or neutral. However, emotion detection aims at finding out more specific sentiment tones such as happiness, sadness, depression, anxiety, etc. Emotion detection can be applied to different types of unstructured data with text being one of such types of data.
